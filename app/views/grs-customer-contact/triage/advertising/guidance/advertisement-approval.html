This can be an email confirmation or a proforma.

Internal adverts can be advertised for less than the mandatory 10 working days.

If the approval is not attached or differs from the names on this list please select the 'Vacancy Holder Update Needed' button.

Exception: If the department has a new role that is classed as an exception, this will be flagged clearly by the department and approval will come in the form of an authorised proforma.

If the vacancy holder hasn’t provided the correct approval to allow you to post the vacancy, select the ‘Vacancy Holder Update Needed’ button. 

Note: You should review the whole advert before sending the vacancy back to the vacancy holder.

This will create an email which you will need to amend to request the missing information before selecting ‘Send Correspondence’.
