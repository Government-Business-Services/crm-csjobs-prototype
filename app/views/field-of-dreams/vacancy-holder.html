        <!-- <p>The GRS team receives and responds to a large number of emails. These emails include queries and requests for help about many different subjects and processes associated with GRS. </p>
        <p>This is a varied, complex and time-consuming method of communication, as GRS team members have to receive emails, check information and answer queries within a limited time frame.</p>
        <p>To improve the query process, we have designed a new automated system that gives users the ability to ask questions, get guidance and engage with GRS without having to send emails.</p>
        <p>With direct access to different types of query and a simple, easy to use process, we are sure that users will be able to access information, guidance and to interact with GRS more efficiently and faster than ever before. </p> -->
