		<p>We deliver better services when our workforce reflects the full range of backgrounds and experiences in the society we serve.</p>
		<p>We measure the socio-economic background of our employees and potential recruits in order to improve diversity and inclusion in the Civil Service.</p>
		<p>To do this we need you to fill out a diversity monitoring form. The questions we ask help us to develop an informed strategy for improving social mobility.</p>
		<p>None of the information you give us will be visible as part of your application. It will be used anonymously to monitor the inclusivity of our selection processes. You can select 'prefer not to sayâ€™ if you don't want to answer a question.</p>
